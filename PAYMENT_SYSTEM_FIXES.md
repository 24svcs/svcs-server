# Payment System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

We identified and fixed several issues with the payment system:

1. **Double Payment Issue**: There was a problem where completed payments were incorrectly calculated, resulting in doubled payment amounts in some cases.

2. **Negative Due Balance**: Due to the above issue, some invoices had negative due balances when the paid amount was greater than the invoice total.

3. **Webhook Handling**: The Stripe webhook handling lacked proper logging and validation, making it difficult to debug payment processing issues.

4. **Payment Status Updates**: The transition from PENDING to COMPLETED status wasn't properly clearing pending payments from calculation.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Webhook Handling

- Added detailed logging for Stripe webhook events
- Improved error handling for signature verification and webhook processing
- Added specific exception handling for different types of errors

### 2. Fixed Payment Model

- Enhanced the `save` method to properly detect status changes
- Added logging for status transitions to track payment lifecycle
- Ensured the invoice status is updated correctly when payment status changes

### 3. Improved Invoice Status Update Logic

- Modified `update_status_based_on_payments` to use direct database queries for calculations
- Added detailed logging for invoice status changes
- Enhanced logic to prevent unnecessary database updates when status doesn't change

### 4. Fixed Invoice Properties

- Updated `paid_amount` to use proper database aggregation
- Added clarifying comments about completed vs pending payments
- Fixed potential caching issues in property calculations

### 5. User Interface Improvements

- Updated the HTML template to clearly show different payment amounts:
  - Invoice total
  - Already paid amount
  - Pending payments (with visual distinction)
  - Available to pay amount
- Made the payment button text clearer by including the amount

### 6. API Response Clarity

- Renamed the ambiguous `amount` field to `available_to_pay` for clarity
- Ensured consistent field naming between various API endpoints
- Made sure pending payments are clearly distinguished from completed payments

### 7. Diagnostic and Fix Tools

- Created a diagnostic script to identify payment issues
- Provided multiple options to fix problematic payments:
  - Mark as refunded
  - Delete duplicate payments
  - Adjust payment amounts

## Verification

- Manual testing confirmed that invoices now show correct payment amounts
- Diagnostic script can identify and fix problematic invoices

## Future Improvements

- Add more extensive unit tests for the payment lifecycle
- Implement transaction management for critical payment operations
- Consider adding an audit log specifically for payment status changes
- Add automated monitoring for payment inconsistencies
